Throttle and debounce functions.

This module is the same as [jquery-throttle-debounce][jquery-throttle-debounce]
([with some differences](#differences-with-original-module)), but it’s
transferred to ES Modules and CommonJS format.

## Install

```sh
npm install throttle-debounce --save
```

## Usage

### `throttle`

```js
import { throttle } from 'throttle-debounce';

const throttleFunc = throttle(1000, false, (num) => {
	console.log('num:', num);
});

// Can also be used like this, because noTrailing is false by default
const throttleFunc = throttle(1000, (num) => {
	console.log('num:', num);
});

throttleFunc(1); // Will execute the callback
throttleFunc(2); // Won’t execute callback
throttleFunc(3); // Won’t execute callback

// Will execute the callback, because noTrailing is false,
// but if we set noTrailing to true, this callback won’t be executed
throttleFunc(4);

setTimeout(() => {
	throttleFunc(10); // Will execute the callback
}, 1200);

// Output
// num: 1
// num: 4
// num: 10
```

### `debounce`

```js
import { debounce } from 'throttle-debounce';

const debounceFunc = debounce(1000, false, (num) => {
	console.log('num:', num);
});

// Can also be used like this, because atBegin is false by default
const debounceFunc = debounce(1000, (num) => {
	console.log('num:', num);
});

// Won’t execute the callback, because atBegin is false,
// but if we set atBegin to true, this callback will be executed.
debounceFunc(1);

debounceFunc(2); // Won’t execute callback
debounceFunc(3); // Won’t execute callback

// Will execute the callback,
// but if we set atBegin to true, this callback won’t be executed.
debounceFunc(4);

setTimeout(() => {
	debounceFunc(10); // Will execute the callback
}, 1200);

// Output
// num: 4
// num: 10
```

### Cancelling

Debounce and throttle can both be cancelled by calling the `cancel` function.

```js
const throttleFunc = throttle(300, () => {
	// Throttled function
});

throttleFunc.cancel();

const debounceFunc = debounce(300, () => {
	// Debounced function
});

debounceFunc.cancel();
```

The logic that is being throttled or debounced will no longer be called.

## API

### throttle(delay, noTrailing, callback, debounceMode)

Returns: `Function`

Throttle execution of a function. Especially useful for rate limiting execution
of handlers on events like resize and scroll.

#### delay

Type: `Number`

A zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100
or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.

#### noTrailing

Type: `Boolean`

Optional, defaults to false. If noTrailing is true, callback will only execute
every `delay` milliseconds while the throttled-function is being called. If
noTrailing is false or unspecified, callback will be executed one final time
after the last throttled-function call. (After the throttled-function has not
been called for `delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset)

#### callback

Type: `Function`

A function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all
arguments are passed through, as-is, to `callback` when the throttled-function
is executed.

#### debounceMode

Type: `Boolean`

If `debounceMode` is true (at begin), schedule `clear` to execute after `delay`
ms. If `debounceMode` is false (at end), schedule `callback` to execute after
`delay` ms.

### debounce(delay, atBegin, callback)

Returns: `Function`

Debounce execution of a function. Debouncing, unlike throttling, guarantees that
a function is only executed a single time, either at the very beginning of a
series of calls, or at the very end.

#### delay

Type: `Number`

A zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100
or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.

#### atBegin

Type: `Boolean`

Optional, defaults to false. If `atBegin` is false or unspecified, callback will
only be executed `delay` milliseconds after the last debounced-function call. If
`atBegin` is true, callback will be executed only at the first
debounced-function call. (After the throttled-function has not been called for
`delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset).

#### callback

Type: `Function`

A function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all
arguments are passed through, as-is, to `callback` when the debounced-function
is executed.

## Differences with original module

-   Dependancy on jQuery is removed, so if you rely on GUIDs set by jQuery, plan
    accordingly
-   There is no standalone version available, so don’t rely on `$.throttle` and
    `$.debounce` to be available

## Browser support

Tested in IE9+ and all modern browsers.

## Test

For automated tests, run `npm run test:automated` (append `:watch` for watcher
support).
