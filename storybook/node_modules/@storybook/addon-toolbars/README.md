# Storybook Toolbars Addon

The Toolbars addon controls global story rendering options from [Storybook's](https://storybook.js.org) toolbar UI. It's a general purpose addon that can be used to:

- set a theme for your components
- set your components' internationalization (i18n) locale
- configure just about anything in Storybook that makes use of a global variable

## Installation

Toolbars is part of [essentials](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/introduction) and so is installed in all new Storybooks by default. If you need to add it to your Storybook, you can run:

```sh
npm i -D @storybook/addon-toolbars
```

Then, add following content to [`.storybook/main.js`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-your-storybook-project):

```js
module.exports = {
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-toolbars'],
};
```

## Usage

The usage is documented in the [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/toolbars-and-globals).

## FAQs

### How does this compare to `addon-contexts`?

`Addon-toolbars` is the successor to `addon-contexts`, which provided convenient global toolbars in Storybook's toolbar.

The primary difference between the two packages is that `addon-toolbars` makes use of Storybook's new **Story Args** feature, which has the following advantages:

- **Standardization**. Args are built into Storybook in 6.x. Since `addon-toolbars` is based on args, you don't need to learn any addon-specific APIs to use it.

- **Ergonomics**. Global args are easy to consume [in stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/toolbars-and-globals#consuming-globals-from-within-a-story), in [Storybook Docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/main/addons/docs), or even in other addons.

* **Framework compatibility**. Args are completely framework-independent, so `addon-toolbars` is compatible with React, Vue, Angular, etc. out of the box with no framework logic needed in the addon.
