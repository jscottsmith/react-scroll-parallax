# Storybook CSF Tools

An experimental library to read, analyze, transform, and write CSF programmatically.

- Read - Parse a CSF file with Babel
- Analyze - Extract its metadata & stories based on the Babel AST
- Write - Write the AST back to a file

It can can parse MDX into CSF.

Coming soon:

- Transform - Update the AST to add/remove/modify stories & metadata (TODO)
