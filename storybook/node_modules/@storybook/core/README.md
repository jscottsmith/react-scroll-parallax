# Storybook Core

This package contains common data structures and bootstrapping capabilities used among the different frameworks (React, RN, Vue, Ember, Angular, etc).

It is a proxy package (for backwards compatibility) that is implemented by

- `@storybook/core-client` - common code that runs in the browser
- `@storybook/core-server` - common code that runs in node (dev server, etc.)
