[**remark**][remark] plugin to add anchors headings using GitHub’s algorithm.

> ⚠️ Note: This is often useful when compiling to HTML.
> If you’re doing that, it’s probably smarter to use
> [`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype] and [`rehype-slug`][rehype-slug] and benefit
> from the [**rehype**][rehype] ecosystem.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did previously!

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-slug
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# Lorem ipsum 😪

## dolor—sit—amet

### consectetur &amp; adipisicing

#### elit

##### elit
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var unified = require('unified')
var markdown = require('remark-parse')
var slug = require('remark-slug')
var remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
var html = require('rehype-stringify')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(slug)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(html)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<h1 id="lorem-ipsum-">Lorem ipsum 😪</h1>
<h2 id="dolorsitamet">dolor—sit—amet</h2>
<h3 id="consectetur--adipisicing">consectetur &#x26; adipisicing</h3>
<h4 id="elit">elit</h4>
<h5 id="elit-1">elit</h5>
```

## API

### `remark().use(slug)`

Add anchors headings using GitHub’s algorithm.

Uses [`github-slugger`][ghslug] to creates GitHub-style slugs.

Sets `data.id` and `data.hProperties.id` on headings.
The first can be used by any plugin as a unique identifier, the second tells
[`mdast-util-to-hast`][to-hast] (used in [`remark-html`][remark-html] and
[`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype]) to use its value as an `id` attribute.

## Security

Use of `remark-slug` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack as it sets `id` attributes on headings.
In a browser, elements are retrievable by `id` with JavaScript and CSS.
If a user injects a heading that slugs to an id you are already using,
the user content may impersonate the website.

Always be wary with user input and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize].
