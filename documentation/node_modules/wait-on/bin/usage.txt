Usage: wait-on {OPTIONS} resource [...resource]

Description:

     wait-on is a command line utility which will wait for files, ports,
     sockets, and http(s) resources to become available (or not available
     using reverse flag). Exits with  success code (0) when all resources
     are ready. Non-zero exit code if interrupted or timed out.

     Options may also be specified in a config file (js or json). For
     example --config configFile.js would result in configFile.js being
     required and the resulting object will be merged with any
     command line options before wait-on is called. See exampleConfig.js

     In shell combine with && to conditionally run another command
     once resources are available. ex: wait-on f1 && NEXT_CMD

     resources types are defined by their prefix, if no prefix is
     present, the resource is assumed to be of type 'file'

     resource prefixes are:

       file:      - regular file (also default type). ex: file:/path/to/file
       http:      - HTTP HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: http://m.com:90/foo
       https:     - HTTPS HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: https://my/bar
       http-get:  - HTTP GET returns 2XX response. ex: http-get://m.com:90/foo
       https-get: - HTTPS GET returns 2XX response. ex: https-get://my/bar
       tcp:       - TCP port is listening. ex: tcp:1.2.3.4:9000 or tcp:foo.com:700
       socket:    - Domain Socket is listening. ex: socket:/path/to/sock
                    For http over socket, use http://unix:SOCK_PATH:URL_PATH
                    like http://unix:/path/to/sock:/foo/bar or
                         http-get://unix:/path/to/sock:/foo/bar

Standard Options:

 -c, --config

  js or json config file, useful for http(s) options

 -d, --delay

  Initial delay before checking for resources in ms, default 0

 --httpTimeout

  Maximum time in ms to wait for an HTTP HEAD/GET request, default 0
  which results in using the OS default

 -i, --interval

  Interval to poll resources in ms, default 250ms

 -l, --log

  Log resources begin waited on and when complete or errored

 -r, --reverse

  Reverse operation, wait for resources to NOT be available

 -s, --simultaneous

  Simultaneous / Concurrent connections to a resource, default Infinity
  Setting this to 1 would delay new requests until previous one has completed.
  Used to limit the number of connections attempted to a resource at a time.

 -t, --timeout

  Maximum time in ms to wait before exiting with failure (1) code,
  default Infinity

  --tcpTimeout

  Maximum time in ms for tcp connect, default 300ms

 -v, --verbose

  Enable debug output to stdout

 -w, --window

  Stability window, the time in ms defining the window of time that
  resource needs to have not changed (file size/availability) before
  signaling success, default 750ms. If less than interval, it will be
  reset to the value of interval. This is only used for files, other
  resources are considered available on first detection.
