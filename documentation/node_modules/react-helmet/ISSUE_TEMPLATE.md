**What is the current behavior?**

**If the current behavior is a bug, 
please provide the steps to reproduce and if

Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your 
code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React and react-helmet. 
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or 
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
