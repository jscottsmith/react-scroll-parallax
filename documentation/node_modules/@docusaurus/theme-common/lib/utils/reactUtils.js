// This hook is like useLayoutEffect, but without the SSR warning
// It seems hacky but it's used in many React libs (Redux, Formik...)
// Also mentioned here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16956
// It is useful when you need to update a ref as soon as possible after a React render (before useEffect)
export const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
// Permits to transform an unstable callback (like an arrow function provided as props)
// to a "stable" callback that is safe to use in a useEffect dependency array
// Useful to avoid React stale closure problems + avoid useless effect re-executions
//
// Workaround until the React team recommends a good solution, see https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16956
// This generally works has some potential drawbacks, such as https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16956#issuecomment-536636418
