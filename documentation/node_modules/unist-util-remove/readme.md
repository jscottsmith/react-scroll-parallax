[**unist**][unist] utility to modify the given tree by removing all nodes that
pass the given test.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install unist-util-remove
```

## Use

```js
var u = require('unist-builder')
var remove = require('unist-util-remove')

var tree = u('root', [
  u('leaf', '1'),
  u('node', [
    u('leaf', '2'),
    u('node', [u('leaf', '3'), u('other', '4')]),
    u('node', [u('leaf', '5')])
  ]),
  u('leaf', '6')
])

// Remove all nodes of type `leaf`.
remove(tree, 'leaf')

console.dir(tree, {depth: null})
```

Yields: (note the parent of `5` is also removed, due to `options.cascade`)

```js
{
  type: 'root',
  children: [
    {
      type: 'node',
      children: [
        { type: 'node', children: [ { type: 'other', value: '4' } ] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## API

### `remove(tree[, options][, test])`

Mutate the given [tree][] by removing all nodes that pass `test`.
The tree is walked in [preorder][] (NLR), visiting the node itself, then its
[head][], etc.

###### Parameters

*   `tree` ([`Node?`][node])
    — [Tree][] to filter
*   `options.cascade` (`boolean`, default: `true`)
    — Whether to drop parent nodes if they had children, but all their children
    were filtered out
*   `test` ([`Test`][is], optional) — [`is`][is]-compatible test (such as a
    [type][])

###### Returns

[`Node?`][node] — The given `tree` with nodes for which `test` passed removed.
`null` is returned if `tree` itself didn’t pass the test, or is cascaded away.
