# Advanced Banners

The `<ParallaxBanner>` accepts advanced configurations that can allow you to really push the effect. Building off the [previous banner demos](/docs/examples/banners), this one adds a number of configuration options.

## How it's done

The following is a breakdown of some of the more advanced configuration for the banner seen above.

1. You are not limited to using only `speed` to control movement. In this example `translateY` is defined with custom start and end values. This is helpful when the banner starts at the top of the page.
2. Setting `shouldAlwaysCompleteAnimation` ensures that the animation begins at the initial position in the view, and since this banner is placed at the top of the page this option is enabled.
3. Additional `scale` effects are used to further enhance the scenes depth and are also provided individual `easing` values.
4. Certain layers set `expanded` to `false`. This is because they don't move or have no edge that would appear visible so there is no need to expand them.
5. Lastly, a gradient overlay is added to dim the scene with an `opacity` transition.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const background: BannerLayer = {
    image:
      'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/105988/banner-background.jpg',
    translateY: [0, 50],
    opacity: [1, 0.3],
    scale: [1.05, 1, 'easeOutCubic'],
    shouldAlwaysCompleteAnimation: true,
  };

  const headline: BannerLayer = {
    translateY: [0, 30],
    scale: [1, 1.05, 'easeOutCubic'],
    shouldAlwaysCompleteAnimation: true,
    expanded: false,
    children: (
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl md:text-8xl text-white font-thin">
          Hello World!
        </h1>
      </div>
    ),
  };

  const foreground: BannerLayer = {
    image:
      'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/105988/banner-foreground.png',
    translateY: [0, 15],
    scale: [1, 1.1, 'easeOutCubic'],
    shouldAlwaysCompleteAnimation: true,
  };

  const gradientOverlay: BannerLayer = {
    opacity: [0, 0.9],
    shouldAlwaysCompleteAnimation: true,
    expanded: false,
    children: (
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-gray-900 to-blue-900" />
    ),
  };

  return (
    <ParallaxBanner
      layers={[background, headline, foreground, gradientOverlay]}
      className="aspect-[2/1] bg-gray-900"
    />
  );
};
```

:::info

Each layer of the `<ParallaxBanner>` is just a `useParallax` hook targeting a `<div>`. Which means anything you can use to configure [`useParallax`](/docs/usage/hooks/use-parallax) can be used as a property of a `layer`. See all [effects and configuration](/docs/usage/parallax-props) accepted.
